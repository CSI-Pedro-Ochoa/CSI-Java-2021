* How much thought have you put into what you're going to use your time for?
* Segment your expected phases using `if else` statements and age ranges.
  * This will vary by person. 
    * Some may chose to study Engineering, Medicine or Law amongst many other professions.
    * Some may not.  
  * Lets start with our formative years

```java
// -----=====88888=====-----
//    Lifetime accounting
// -----=====88888=====-----
if(age<18){
}
```

  * Add the years you intent to study and the degrees you would like to accumulate. 
    * Research the degrees and practice years expected for your profession.
    * I studied a Bachelors of Engineering and it took me 5 years. I worked for a few years and would now like to do a masters.
  
```java
// Formative years
if(age < 18){
} 
// Engineering Baccalaureate
else if ( age < 23){
}
// Industry Experience
else if (age < 25){
}
// Masters Degree
else if (age < 28){
}
```   

  * Include the amount of years you expect to work. The standard age for retirement is 65.
  * Add a retirement gap.

```java
...
// Masters Degree
else if (age < 28){
}
// Work
else if (age < 55){
}
// Retirement
else {

}
```
