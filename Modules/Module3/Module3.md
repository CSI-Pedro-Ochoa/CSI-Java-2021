# Module 3: Data Types

### Merge origin/master. This is the same as Fetching Upstream. Create a commit. `(1pts)`

### Create an eclipse project called MainProject in the root directory of your CSI-Java-2021 directory.`(3pts)`
eg: 
>C:\Users\carlos.cobian\Documents\Courses\CSI-Java-2021\MainProject
* Use the same package name that was used in Module2
* Create a Java Class called DataTypes.java
* [Copy and run this code from GitHub.](https://gist.github.com/Aivirth/ff7cb6cf88d3edd77edad8fa6221b20b)

<br>

# Data Types

### Integer
In whole numbers are called `integers`. Programmers usually count using integers. 
>Example: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 14, 2019

<br>

### Float
In coding, numbers with a decimal point are known as `floats`. It's Full name is <u>Decimal Floating Point Number</u>. It uses 32 bits to store a fractional number. 
>Example: -1.25, -1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.33

<br>

### Double
A `double`'s full name is <u>Double Precision Decimal Floating Point Number</u>(float64). It holds decimals with a larger number of fractional digits(numbers at the right side of the decimal point). It uses 64 bits
>Example: -1.25, -1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.33

<br>

### String
Programmers use the word strings to refer to blocks of text or any data made up of a sequence of characters. Strings are a single data object; They are surrounded by double quote (") characters. 
>Example: "a", "aa", "Hello!", "101 Dalmatians"

<br>

### char 
>Example: ''

<br>

### Boolean
A Boolean is a value that is represented by a single bit. This means that it is either true or false. Booleans are used as a part of logic. Various operators may determine whether a statement is true or false such as equals(`==`) or greater than(`>`).
>Example:
>
>i = 10
>
>(i < 15) is False

<br>

### Object
You may define your own data type. In <u>object oriented languages</u> such as Java or C#, everything is an object.

<br>

### Null
A null or None type represents the absence of a value. This differs from, say 0, in that 0 is present value. 

<br>

### Array
An array is a list, or collection, of a certain data type. An array is treated as its own data type since it acts like a container.

<br>

## Data Types

| Data Type | Syntax | 
|-----------|--------|
| Integer | `int i = 42;` <br> `int x,y = 42;` <br> `Integer i = 42;` |
| Float | `float f = 5.2f;` <br> `float f = 5f;` is equal to 5.0 |
| Double | `double d = 5.2` <br> `Double d = 5.0` |
| char | `char c = 's';` |
| String | `String s = "Hello World!";` |
| Boolean | true, false, >, <, ==, >=, <=, ! |
| Object | `Object o = Object();` |
| Void/Null | `Object o = null` |
| Array | `int[] integerArray = new int[5];` <br> initializes an empty(null) array of length 5 <br> `int[] arr = {4, 3, -1, 4, 34}` |

<br>

## Variables

A variable can store a value.  In Python, programmers assign variables by using the equals sign "`=`". 

Example: 

```python
age = 21

print(age)
```
>21

### Take a screenshot of the console output and save it in the Module3 directory as: `CSI-Name-Lastname-Module3.png`.

<br>

### Commit and push all of the project files and the image before the next lecture.
