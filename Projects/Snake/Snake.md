# Snake `(40 pts)`

<br>

## [This website contains a basic implementation of the game *Snake*](https://zetcode.com/javagames/snake/)
 
<br>

1. Create a package inside of your main project called:
>*csi.lastname.snake*
2. Copy the `Board.java` and `Snake.java` classes into this package.


You will notice that when you try to run the code it does not succeed. This is because the project is missing some resources. Notice how `Board.java` has a method called loadImages(). In here you will see which images are expected and in which location they should be stored.

3. Find images for the head, body and apple. They must be appropriate for a classroom. 
4. [Resize the images to be 50 pixels by 50 pixels.](https://resizeimage.net/)
5.  Take advantage of PNG transparency.
6.  Set `B_WIDTH` and `B_HEIGHT` to **800**.
7.  Set `DOT_SIZE` and `ALL_DOTS` to **50**.
8.  Set `RAND_POS` to 10.
   
<br>

### You should now be able to run the snake game. `(10pts)`

<br>

## Objectives:
1. Modify background color. `(10pts)`
   * It may be a visually appealing image that compliments playability.
2. Implement a score counter.`(10pts)`
3. Implement a key to reset the game.`(10pts)`
